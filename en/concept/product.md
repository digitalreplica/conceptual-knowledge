# Summary
A product is a tangible or intangible item that is created and offered for sale to customers in the marketplace. Tangible products are physical goods that can be touched, held, and seen, such as clothing, electronics, or furniture. On the other hand, intangible products are services or experiences that are provided to customers, such as consulting services, software applications, or online courses.
