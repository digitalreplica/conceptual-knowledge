# Summary
A process or procedure is a series of organized, systematic, and structured steps or actions taken to achieve a specific goal or outcome. These steps are designed to ensure that tasks are carried out efficiently, consistently, and accurately. Processes and procedures are commonly used in various industries, businesses, and organizations to guide employees, streamline operations, and maintain quality standards. They can be documented in the form of written instructions, flowcharts, or checklists to ensure clarity and ease of use.

Businesses more commonly use the word "process" than "procedure." While both terms refer to a set of actions, a process is typically more broad and encompasses the entire sequence of activities that lead to a desired outcome. A process can cover many aspects of business operations, including production, service delivery, management, and decision-making.

A procedure, on the other hand, is a specific, well-defined step within a process. It's a more detailed and focused part of a process that outlines how to perform a task. For example, a manufacturing process might have a sequence of procedures for each stage of production.

In general, businesses might use the term "process" in discussions about organizational structures, strategy, and efficiency, while "procedure" is more commonly used when referring to the step-by-step instructions for carrying out a task or task flow. However, the distinction between the two terms is not always strict, and they can be used interchangeably in some contexts.
