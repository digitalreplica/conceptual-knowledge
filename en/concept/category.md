# Summary
A category is a conceptual grouping that arises from recognizing patterns or shared characteristics among a set of entities. It is a basic mental tool that humans use to organize information, concepts, experiences, and objects into efficient and manageable segments. By creating categories, we can understand and navigate the complexity of the world around us without becoming overwhelmed by every unique detail.

Categories are created through the process of abstraction, where we identify commonalities or similarities among items and disregard the less relevant differences. This involves two key steps: First, we establish the criteria or attributes that define the category; second, we apply these criteria to determine which entities belong to that category and which do not. The criteria for category membership can range from concrete features, like shape and color, to more abstract traits, like purpose or behavior.

The creation of categories is a dynamic and sometimes subjective process, influenced by cultural, personal, and contextual factors. As we gather more information and our understanding evolves, we may refine our categories, create subcategories, or even establish entirely new ones. Through categorizing, we create a structured knowledge framework, which aids in communication, learning, and prediction.
