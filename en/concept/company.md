# Summary
The terms "business" and "company" are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two:

1. Business: A business is a broader concept that refers to any activity or enterprise engaged in commercial, industrial, or professional activities with the aim of earning profit. It can encompass sole proprietorships, partnerships, cooperatives, and even non-profit organizations. A business can be small, such as a local store, or large, like a multinational corporation. The primary focus of a business is to provide goods or services to customers.

2. Company: A company is a specific type of business entity or organization that is formed under the laws of a jurisdiction to carry out commercial activities. It typically refers to a legal entity that has a separate legal personality from its owners, meaning it can enter into contracts, own assets, and incur liabilities independently. Companies are often structured as corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), or partnerships, and they can be publicly traded or privately owned. Companies are usually created to conduct business activities, generate profits, and distribute those profits among shareholders.

In summary, a business is a general term for any entity involved in commercial activities, while a company is a more specific type of business entity with a legal structure that provides liability protection for its owners.
